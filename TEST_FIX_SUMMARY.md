# React Component Test Fixes Summary

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Jest Setup Improvements** (`jest.setup.js`)
- Added `IntersectionObserver` mock
- Fixed framer-motion mock to avoid `__rest` errors
- Added Canvas context mock for chart components
- Temporarily disabled MSW server due to import issues (created stub)

### 2. **Common Test Utilities**
- Created `src/test-utils/commonMocks.ts` with reusable mocks
- Updated `src/test-utils/renderWithProviders.tsx` with QueryClientProvider
- Created mock for missing `@/modules/teams/services/teamService`

### 3. **Specific Test Fixes**
- **NotificationBell**: Fixed animation timing issues in close test
- **useAuth**: Fixed overlapping act() calls by combining async operations
- **Navigation**: Added mocks for ThemeContext and navigationConfig
- **HeatMapChart**: Updated mocks for custom UI components

## 📊 Results

- **Before**: Most tests failing due to missing mocks and setup issues
- **After**: 26 out of 32 test suites passing (81% pass rate)
- **Passing Tests**: 68 tests
- **Failing Tests**: 10 tests (mostly due to specific component issues)

## 🔧 Common Issues Fixed

1. **Missing React Testing Library setup**: Added proper imports and mocks
2. **Missing component mocks**: Created mocks for UI components, contexts, and services
3. **Provider wrapping**: Added QueryClientProvider to renderWithProviders
4. **Animation/timing issues**: Fixed with proper waitFor usage and timeouts
5. **Canvas/Chart mocks**: Added comprehensive Canvas API mocks

## 📝 Remaining Issues

Some tests still fail due to:
- Specific component implementation details
- Complex chart component mocks (Sankey, HeatMap)
- Navigation component's group-based structure

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Import test utilities:
```typescript
import { renderWithProviders } from '@/test-utils/renderWithProviders';
import { mockAuthContext, mockUseRouter } from '@/test-utils/commonMocks';
```

2. Use proper mocking patterns:
```typescript
jest.mock('@/context/AuthContext', () => ({
  useAuth: () => mockAuthContext
}));
```

3. Handle animations:
```typescript
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
}, { timeout: 2000 });
```

## 💡 Best Practices

1. Always mock external dependencies (contexts, hooks, services)
2. Use `renderWithProviders` for components that need providers
3. Add timeouts for animation-heavy components
4. Mock complex UI libraries at the component level
5. Create reusable mocks in `commonMocks.ts`
